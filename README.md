Joyspyck is an application that helps you to create controllers from scratch. It makes easy turning I/O hardware devices like I/O expanders, ADCs or accelerometers into uinput devices that can be used to interface with your computer.

Joyspyck is based on uinput and written in Python by Noemi Escudero ([Naeriam](https://github.com/naeriam)) and Guillermo Climent ([Willyneutron](https://github.com/willyneutron)).
